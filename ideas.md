  **Design Movement**: Neo-Brutalism / Tech-Industrial
  
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Raw Authenticity**: Exposing the structure, using monospaced fonts for headers to reflect the "under the hood" nature of IT work.
  2. **High Contrast & Clarity**: Stark black and white with a single electric accent color (Cyber Yellow or Neon Green) to highlight critical data points like certifications.
  3. **Modular Efficiency**: Content is organized in strict, bordered grid blocks that resemble server racks or database tables.
  4. **Directness**: No fluff, just hard skills and experience presented with machine-like precision.

  **Color Philosophy**: 
  - **Background**: Off-white (#F5F5F5) or Deep Charcoal (#1A1A1A) - stark, clean canvas.
  - **Text**: Jet Black (#000000) or Pure White (#FFFFFF) for maximum readability.
  - **Accent**: Electric Lime (#CCFF00) or Safety Orange (#FF5500) - used sparingly for buttons and active states, symbolizing alerts and system status.
  - *Reasoning*: Reflects the no-nonsense, problem-solving nature of IT support and cybersecurity. It feels like a terminal or a diagnostic tool.

  **Layout Paradigm**: 
  - **Bento Box Grid**: A masonry-style layout where each section (Experience, Skills, Certs) is a self-contained card with thick borders.
  - **Asymmetric Balance**: Not everything is centered. Headers might be sticky on the left while content scrolls on the right.

  **Signature Elements**:
  1. **Thick Borders**: 2px-3px solid borders around all interactive elements and sections.
  2. **Monospace Headers**: Using a coding font for titles to emphasize technical proficiency.
  3. **Glitch/Terminal Effects**: Subtle hover states that mimic a cursor blink or a command-line prompt.

  **Interaction Philosophy**: 
  - **Tactile Feedback**: Buttons have hard shadows that depress when clicked.
  - **Instant Response**: Transitions are snappy (0.1s), no long fades. It feels fast and responsive like a well-tuned system.

  **Animation**: 
  - **Typewriter Effect**: For the hero section introduction.
  - **Reveal on Scroll**: Sections slide up with a hard stop, no bounce.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Display**: 'JetBrains Mono' or 'Space Mono' (Google Fonts) - Technical, precise.
  - **Body**: 'Inter' or 'Public Sans' - Clean, legible, neutral.

  **Design Movement**: Glassmorphism / Future-Corporate
  
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Transparency & Depth**: Using frosted glass effects to create layers, symbolizing the depth of knowledge and the "cloud" aspect of his GCP skills.
  2. **Fluidity**: Soft gradients and rounded shapes that flow into each other, representing adaptability and customer service skills.
  3. **Professional Polish**: A clean, high-end look that fits corporate environments but feels modern and forward-thinking (2026).
  4. **Trust & Security**: Using blues and teals to evoke stability and security, essential for a cybersecurity professional.

  **Color Philosophy**: 
  - **Background**: Deep Navy (#0F172A) to Slate Blue gradients.
  - **Glass Layers**: White with low opacity (10-20%) and background blur.
  - **Text**: White and Light Grey (#E2E8F0).
  - **Accent**: Cyan (#06B6D4) and Violet (#8B5CF6) gradients.
  - *Reasoning*: Connects to the "Cloud" and "Security" themes. It feels premium, calm, and highly competent.

  **Layout Paradigm**: 
  - **Floating Cards**: Content sits on floating glass cards over a subtle, moving gradient background.
  - **Central Spine**: A timeline-based layout for experience, guiding the eye down the career path.

  **Signature Elements**:
  1. **Frosted Glass**: Backdrop-filter: blur(10px) on cards and navigation.
  2. **Glowing Borders**: Subtle 1px gradients on card edges to define them against the dark background.
  3. **Abstract Data Orbs**: Blurred circles of color floating in the background.

  **Interaction Philosophy**: 
  - **Smooth Flow**: Hovering over cards causes them to lift slightly and glow brighter.
  - **Parallax**: Background elements move slower than foreground content, creating 3D depth.

  **Animation**: 
  - **Float**: Background orbs gently pulse and move.
  - **Fade & Scale**: Content cards fade in and scale up slightly as they enter the viewport.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Display**: 'Outfit' or 'Plus Jakarta Sans' - Modern, geometric sans-serif.
  - **Body**: 'DM Sans' - Friendly but professional.

  **Design Movement**: Swiss Style / International Typographic Style (Modernized)
  
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Grid Systems**: Mathematical precision in layout, reflecting the logical nature of IT and networking.
  2. **Asymmetry**: Dynamic layouts that use negative space to guide the eye, avoiding static centering.
  3. **Typography as Image**: Large, bold type used as the primary visual element, reducing the need for decoration.
  4. **Clarity & Objectivity**: Presenting information in the most legible, structured way possible.

  **Color Philosophy**: 
  - **Background**: Crisp White (#FFFFFF) or extremely light grey (#F8F9FA).
  - **Text**: Dark Grey (#212529) - softer than black for better reading comfort.
  - **Accent**: International Orange (#FF3300) or Cobalt Blue (#0047AB) - used only for key highlights like dates or links.
  - *Reasoning*: Timeless, authoritative, and highly readable. It communicates "I am organized, precise, and professional."

  **Layout Paradigm**: 
  - **Modular Grid**: A strict 12-column grid where text blocks span specific columns, creating a rhythmic reading experience.
  - **Split Screen**: Fixed navigation/header on the left (25%), scrolling content on the right (75%).

  **Signature Elements**:
  1. **Huge Typography**: Section headers (Experience, Education) are massive (5rem+) and sometimes cropped or vertical.
  2. **Horizontal Rules**: Thin, precise lines separating every entry.
  3. **Structured Lists**: Skills and certifications presented in clean, aligned columns.

  **Interaction Philosophy**: 
  - **Micro-Interactions**: Links have a simple underline animation that expands from left to right.
  - **Focus**: Hovering over a section dims the others slightly to focus attention.

  **Animation**: 
  - **Slide & Reveal**: Text slides out from behind invisible masks.
  - **Staggered Load**: List items load one by one with a quick snap.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Display**: 'Helvetica Now' (or 'Inter' Tight/Display) - The gold standard of neutrality.
  - **Body**: 'Roboto' or 'Inter' - Optimized for screen reading.
